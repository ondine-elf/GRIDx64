    - Optionally get rid of boot.S, or add some initial bootstrap code for setting
      up a custom stack, GDT, and paging
    
    - Consider getting rid of non 32-bit pixel support in src/console/ for efficiency.
      You also need to make the console driver more robust, as it failed in your previous
      multiboot configuration

    - Maybe move src/drivers/fonts/ to somewhere else, as it's not worth an entire folder :-)

    - Redo src/interrupts. It is not x64 compatible and is a mess anyways.

    - You also need to redo lib and fix the include files. Make it more neat and optionally
      implement some optimized memory algorithms.

    - Rename the tools/tmp.py file to emphasize that it converts .psf files to .h files

    - Consider creating a higher-half kernel in your linker script

    - You have to create an efi image in your build system

    - NEVER FORGET -MNO-RED-ZONE AND -MCMODEL = LARGE!!!!!
